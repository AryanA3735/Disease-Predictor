# Smart-Health-Predictor

Since Classical diagonosis requires you to take appointment and then visit the doctor it's time consuming in case of mild diseases and many a time due to which people ignores it and faces consequences later on that's why I have come up with the idea of predicting diseases using machine learning algorithm.

In basic disease predictor : Here, I have assumed that all symptoms are independent and then applied bayes classifier to predict the disease based on symptoms provided.
In Adv disease predictor I have used four machine learning algorithms: 
  1. Decision Tree Algorithm
  2. Random Forest Algorithm
  3. K Nearest Neighbour Algorithm
  4. Naive Bayes Algorithm 
I predicted diseases using all of these algorithms seperately.
