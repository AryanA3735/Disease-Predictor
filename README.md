# Smart-Health-Predictor

Since Classical diagonosis requires you to take appointment and then visit the doctor it's time consuming in case of mild diseases and many a time due to which people ignores it and faces consequences later on that's why I have come up with the idea of predicting diseases using machine learning algorithm.

In this project I have assumed that all symptoms are independent and then applied bayes classifier to predict the disease based on symptoms provided.
